        <h1 class="hobby1">Reading</h1>
        <p class="hobbies-desc1"> 
            I love reading! Currently I have a lot of books in classical literature, and psychology (informative and self-help). However I've been more open to 
            reading other genres. I have a couple of philosophy books, romantic comedies, science fiction, fiction, memoirs and mystery books. I'm always open to 
            new book suggestions as well!

    <div class="hobby-pair">
        <h1 class="hobby2">Writing</h1>
        <p class="hobbies-desc2"> 
            I also enjoy writing, and any form of it! I have a personal diary I write in but If I feel as if I want to do some creative writing, I've written a few poems
            for myself. Technical writing is also something I've been getting myself into lately as well to further improve my writing skills as an upcoming researcher. 
            Any general tips or suggestions on writing are always welcome!

    <div class="hobby-pair">
        <h1 class="hobby3">Coding</h1>
        <p class="hobbies-desc3">
            I've always been into computer science as a kid. I've always wanted to learn how to code and I've been coding for a few years now.
            I've learned a few languages such as Python, Javascript, C/C++, HTML, and CSS. I have a few projects on my github that I've worked on and I'm always finding new
            projects to work on. (I made this website from scratch as well. üòÅ)

    <div class="hobby-pair">
        <h1 class="hobby4">Fitness</h1>
        <p class="hobbies-desc4"> 
            I've been working out for a few years now. I mainly do weightlifting and cardio. Maintaining and having a healthy lifestyle is very important to
            keep for me. Not only does it keep one in shape, but it boosts mental health as well. A good body image and mental health can give one a lot of needed healthy confidence.

    <div class="hobby-pair">
        <h1 class="hobby5">Organizing/Cleaning</h1>
        <p class="hobbies-desc5"> 
            I am a very organized person. I'm always seen cleaning or organizing my belongings. I love decorating or making my room and belongings look nice and aesthetic.
            I am always on top of my own strict schedule. I plan out every single one of my days ahead of time and always make sure 
            that I have time for myself as well and time for emergencies.

    <div class="hobby-pair">
        <h1 class="hobby6">Listening to Music</h1>
        <p class="hobbies-desc6">
            Music is such a big part of my life. I probably listen to an unhealthy amount of music everyday. I mainly listen to alternative rock, indie, dream pop, indie pop,
            and psychedelic pop/rock. My favorite band currently is The Mar√≠as and my favorite single artist is Joji. I actually collect a lot of vinyls from them and my top 
            artists I listen to as well. Including Tame Impala, Men I Trust, Mac Demarco, Girl in Red, Her's, and Clairo.
