                                    to classify images of flowers into five distinct categories: dandelion, daisy, sunflower, tulip, and rose. 
                                    The dataset consists of images that are preprocessed and fed into the CNN model, which is trained to recognize and 
                                    distinguish between the different types of flowers. The process includes data loading, 
                                    preprocessing (resizing images to a uniform size), and augmentation to improve the model's robustness. 
                                    The model is then trained using TensorFlow and Keras libraries, leveraging techniques like data resampling, 
                                    image augmentation, and optimization algorithms. </p>
                                <p class="purpose"> <b> Significance/Purpose: </b> &nbsp The primary purpose of this project is to develop a reliable

                                    This has significant implications in various fields, such as botany, agriculture, and environmental science, 
                                    where accurate identification of plant species is crucial. By automating the classification process,

                                    Snake game using Q-Learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm. The AI learns to navigate the game environment, 
                                    collect food, and avoid obstacles by maximizing cumulative rewards over time. The Q-Learning algorithm allows the
                                    agent to learn optimal strategies through trial and error, updating its knowledge based on the outcomes of its
