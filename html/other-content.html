        I love going on walks during the night or evening. I find them very peaceful and calming. I usually go on these walks when I'm feeling stressed or anxious but I also find that going on these
        later time walks help me clear my mind and relax. It also gives me the chance to think and it's a great alone time activity. I personally tend to find more beauty in nature at 
        night and/or the evening, where things are quiet, dimmed, and peaceful.

        I'm also learning American Sign Language (ASL), I'm not fluent but I'm at a novice level. I've always wanted to learn a new language and 
        ASL has been of most interest to me. I feel that it is a unique language to learn and communicate with compared to other languages. I highly encourage others 
        to give learning other languages a try. It's a fun learning experience!

        As a kid I've always been fascinated by the piano. It's a beautifully sounding and complex instrument that has always captivated me when listening to one. 
        From there, my only option was to try it out myself! I took a couple of lessons and classes in highschool but unfortunately have since dropped it since freshman year (where COVID happened for me). 
        I've been relearning how to read music and have now been picking up piano again.

        I've been cooking for myself for a couple years now, however a bit on and off. I mainly cook breakfast and lunch meals. 
        I normally cook more highly nutritional value meals for myself as my meal-prep for school and work.  
        I've been trying to learn how to cook more international dishes. I've been cooking a lot of filipino and mediterranean dishes lately and I am open to other dish suggestions.

    <p class = "other-desc5"> 
        I've been more into calligraphy lately, and have been trying to perfect my cursive writing skills over the couple of months. The art and design of lettering with a pen,
        ink, or brush is something I find beautiful. Giving form to signs in an expressive, harmonious or skillful manner strikes something satisfying for me. 
        As someone who writes a lot for myself, I find that calligraphy is a great way to express and present my writing in a more meaningful and aesthetic fashion.

    <p class = "other-desc6"> 
        I love rainy & dark cloudy days. I like collecting stuffed animals and my favorite scents are normally sweet, comforting and 
        autumn themed, like pumpkin spice, cinnamon, or bourbon. I love flowers and I help my mom garden whenever I'm home. 
        My favorite candy is twizzlers and dark chocolate. I like pastel and darker colors, most notably pastel pink and dark green.
