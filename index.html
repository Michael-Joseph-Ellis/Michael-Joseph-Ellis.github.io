                        With an interest in academia, I aspire to be a researcher in machine learning and psychology. 
                        My current research primarily focuses on machine learning, human decision-making, and statistics, integrating various methods I encounter. 
                        In machine learning, I'm particularly interested in neural networks, computer vision, and AI/ML advancements in mental healthcare. 
                        My psychological interests include decision-making, psychological processes, and psychometrics. 
                        In statistics, I focus on Bayesian techniques and regression analysis.
