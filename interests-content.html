    <h1 class="interests2">Cognitive Psychology</h1>
    <h1 class="interests3">Statistics</h1>

        Machine learning fascinates me because of its ability to enable computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly 
        programmed. This field merges statistics, computer science, and specialized knowledge to create systems that can make predictions, identify patterns, and provide 
        insights from vast amounts of data. I am particularly interested by the potential applications of machine learning in various sectors, such as healthcare, and
        cognitive modeling. The ties between machine learning and many other fields, namely psychology for me, are what make this field so interesting to me. My 
        dream is to be one of the researchers that help make a fully autonomous AI with decision-making similar to that of a human. An indistinguishable robot!

        Another interest of mine is cognitive psychology. The exploration of mental processes, investigating how we perceive, think, remember, and solve problems. 
        Understanding these mental processes can help improve educational methods, inform artificial intelligence, enhance mental health treatments, and design 
        user-friendly technologies. I am particularly interested in the cognitive processes behind decision-making and problem-solving, as well as the impact of 
        cognitive biases on our daily lives. I wish contribute to research that can lead to better theraputic techniques and educational tools, helping individuals 
        harness their cognitive abilities to improve their quality of life. My ambition is to bridge the gap between cognitive psychyology and artificial intelligence, 
        using insights from cognitive psychology to inform the design of intelligent systems that can understand and interact with humans more effectively.

        Finally, stats! Statistics is an interesting topic for me because it is the science of learning from data. It provides the tools necessary to collect, analyze,
        interpret, and present data in meaningful ways, driving informed decision-making across various fields. The power of statistics lies in its ability to make 
        sense of complex data, identify patterns, and draw conclusions from uncertain information. Statistical modeling and data visualization are particularly drawn
        to me because they allow us to explore relationships between variables, test hypotheses, and communicate findings effectively. Thorough understanding of statistical 
        methodology will help me tackle complex research questions, design robust experiments, and bring clarity to data-driven decisions.
