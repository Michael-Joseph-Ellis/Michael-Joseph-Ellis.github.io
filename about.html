                        I love reading! Currently I have a lot of books in classical literature, and psychology (informative and self-help). However I've been more open to 
                        reading other genres. I have a couple of philosophy books, romantic comedies, science fiction, fiction, memoirs and mystery books. I'm always open to 
                        new book suggestions as well!
                    </p>

                    <p class = "hobbies-desc2"> 
                        I also enjoy writing, and any form of it! I have a personal diary I write in but If I feel as if I want to do some creative writing, I've written a few poems
                        for myself. Technical writing is also something I've been getting myself into lately as well to further improve my writing skills as an upcoming researcher. 
                        Any general tips or suggestions on writing are always welcome!
                    </p>

                    <p class = "hobbies-desc3">
                        I've always been into computer science as a kid. I've always wanted to learn how to code and I've been coding for a few years now.
                        I've learned a few languages such as Python, Javascript, C/C++, HTML, and CSS. I have a few projects on my github that I've worked on and I'm always finding new
                        projects to work on. (I made this website from scratch as well. üòÅ) 
                    </p> 

                    <p class = "hobbies-desc4"> 
                        I've been working out for a few years now. I mainly do weightlifting and cardio. Maintaining and having a healthy lifestyle is very important to
                        keep for me. Not only does it keep one in shape, but it boosts mental health as well. A good body image and mental health can give one a lot of needed healthy confidence. 
                    </p> 

                    <p class = "hobbies-desc5"> 
                        I am a very organized person. I'm always seen cleaning or organizing my belongings. I love decorating or making my room and belongings look nice and aesthetic.
                        I am always ontop of my own strict schedule. I plan out every single one of my days ahead of time and always make sure 
                        that I have time for myself as well and time for emergencies. 
                    </p> 

                    <p class = "hobbies-desc6">
                        Music is such a big part of my life. I probably listen to an unhealthy amount of music everyday. I mainly listen to alternative rock, indie, dream pop, indie pop,
                        and psychedelic pop/rock. My favorite band currently is The Mar√≠as and my favorite single artist is Joji. I actually collect a lot of vinyls from them and my top 
                        artists I listen to as well. Including Tame Impala, Men I Trust, Mac Demarco, Girl in Red, Her's, and Clairo.

                    <h1 class = "interests-icon"> Interests </h1>

                    <p class = "interests-icon-desc">
                        Here are a couple things I take interest in!
                    </p>

                    <h1 class = "interests1"> Machine Learning</h1>
                    <h1 class = "interests2"> Cognitive Psychology</h1>
                    <h1 class = "interests3"> Statistics</h1>
                    
                    <p class = "interests-desc1"> 
                        Machine learning fascinates me because of its ability to enable computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly 
                        programmed. This field merges statistics, computer science, and specialized knowledge to create systems that can make predictions, identify patterns, and provide 
                        insights from vast amounts of data. I am particularly interested by the potential applications of machine learning in various sectors, such as healthcare, and
                        cognitive modeling. The ties between machine learning and many other fields, namely psychology for me, are what make this field so interesting to me. My 
                        dream is to be one of the researchers that help make a fully autonomous AI with decision-making similar to that of a human. An indistinguishable robot!
                    </p>
                    <p class = "interests-desc2"> 
                        Another interest of mine is cognitive psychology. The exploration of mental processes, investigating how we perceive, think, remember, and solve problems. 
                        Understanding these mental processes can help improve educational methods, inform artificial intelligence, enhance mental health treatments, and design 
                        user-friendly technologies. I am particularly interested in the cognitive processes behind decision-making and problem-solving, as well as the impact of 
                        cognitive biases on our daily lives. I wish contribute to research that can lead to better theraputic techniques and educational tools, helping individuals 
                        harness their cognitive abilities to improve their quality of life. My ambition is to bridge the gap between cognitive psychyology and artificial intelligence, 
                        using insights from cognitive psychology to inform the design of intelligent systems that can understand and interact with humans more effectively.
                    </p>
                    <p class = "interests-desc3"> 
                        Finally, stats! Statistics is an interesting topic for me because it is the science of learning from data. It provides the tools necessary to collect, analyze,
                        interpret, and present data in meaningful ways, driving informed decision-making across various fields. The power of statistics lies in its ability to make 
                        sense of complex data, identify patterns, and draw conclusions from uncertain information. Statistical modeling and data visualization are particularly drawn
                        to me because they allow us to explore relationships between variables, test hypotheses, and communicate findings effectively. Thorough understanding of statistical 
                        methodology will help me tackle complex research questions, design robust experiments, and bring clarity to data-driven decisions.

                    <p class = "other-icon-desc"> 
                        Here are some other things that I enjoy doing in my freetime! These include extra
                        hobbies or interests, things I'm currently working on, or my general way of living.
                    </p>

                    <h1 class = "other1"> Going Out For Walks</h1>
                    <h1 class = "other2"> ASL</h1>

                    <p class = "other-desc1"> 
                        I love going on walks during the night or evening. I find them very peaceful and calming. I usually go on these walks when I'm feeling stressed or anxious but I also find that going on these
                        later time walks help me clear my mind and relax. It also gives me the chance to think and it's a great alone time activity. I personally tend to find more beauty in nature at 
                        night and/or the evening, where things are quiet, dimmed, and peaceful. 
                    </p>

                    <p class = "other-desc2"> 
                        I'm also learning American Sign Language (ASL), I'm not fluent but I'm at a novice level. I've always wanted to learn a new language and 
                        ASL has been of most interest to me. I feel that it is a unique language to learn and communicate with compared to other languages. I highly encourage others 
                        to give learning other languages a try. It's a fun learning experience!
                    </p>

                    <p class = "other-desc3"> 
                        As a kid I've always been fascinated by the piano. It's a beautifully sounding and complex instrument that has always captivated me when listening to one. 
                        From there, my only option was to try it out myself! I took a couple of lessons and classes in highschool but unfortunately have since dropped it since freshman year (where COVID happened for me). 
                        I've been relearning how to read music and have now been picking up piano again.   
                    </p>

                    <p class = "other-desc4"> 
                        I've been cooking for myself for a couple years now, however a bit on and off. I mainly cook breakfast and lunch meals. 
                        I normally cook more highly nutritional value meals for myself as my meal-prep for school and work.  
                        I've been trying to learn how to cook more international dishes. I've been cooking a lot of filipino and mediterranean dishes lately and I am open to other dish suggestions.
                    </p>

                    <p class = "other-desc5"> 
                        I've been more into calligraphy lately, and have been trying to perfect my cursive writing skills over the couple of months. The art and design of lettering with a pen,
                        ink, or brush is something I find beautiful. Giving form to signs in an expressive, harmonious or skillful manner strikes something satisfying for me. 
                        As someone who writes a lot for myself, I find that calligraphy is a great way to express and present my writing in a more meaningful and aesthetic fashion.
                    </p>

                    <p class = "other-desc6"> 
                        I love rainy & dark cloudy days. I like collecting stuffed animals and my favorite scents are normally sweet, comforting and 
                        autumn themed, like pumpkin spice, cinnamon, or bourbon. I love flowers and I help my mom garden whenever I'm home. 
                        My favorite candy is twizzlers and dark chocolate. I like pastel and darker colors, most notably pastel pink and dark green.
